# Coded Load Balancing
This is a Monte Carlo simulator to simulate the communication cost and maximum load 
    of servers in content delivery networks (CDNs). Here, we assume that the servers 
    have cached coded chunks of the original files. This simulator have implemented the scheme presented in the paper:
